# COVID-resources-Shiny

`COVID-resources-Shiny` is an R Shiny App developed to provide a dynamic on-line catalog with datasets containing both, genomic sequencing and clinical data for the same patients.

## What is this repository for?

The `COVID-resources-Shiny` is a dynamic catalog that puts together a descriptive summary of open source and publicly available data and informatic resources relevant to the COVID-19 pandemic, to help investigators to identify resources for their research. The table provides the name, url, description and type of each resource. Filtering and searching features are available. Users can submit new entries via the [submission form](https://forms.gle/CpzGm51PqoKG7Y8u9) and also correct the existing ones via this repository (See details below).

## Inclusion criteria

1. Restricted to datasets, software, and related informatics resources relevant to the COVID-19 pandemic
2. The resource must be open source and/or publicly accessible (free of charge) through a website or via a way of collaboration with investigators
3. All the resources (data and website) have to be available in English

All three criteria must be met for a dataset to be considered.
